If you have the error when you are running command line above.

Error like this command:

```

Please go to your mysql bin folder, find the file like my.ini or my.cnf (depends on what you are using) and open it in editor.

Under [mysqld] add this command:

```bash
secure_file_priv="/usr/local/mysql-files"

the path should be where the files stored

Then, restart mysql server. The error should gone now.

If you try to run mysql in terminal and it isn't found, make sure mysql is in your PATH environment variable.
