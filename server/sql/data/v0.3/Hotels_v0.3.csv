El Cortez Hotel and Casino,(800) 634-6703,600 E Fremont St,Las Vegas,Nevada,United States of America,89101,"El Cortez Hotel and Casino is the longest continuously-running casino in Las Vegas. Located off the strip in Fremont East Entertainment District within the historic Downtown, El Cortez is the authentic Vegas experience that you have been craving. El Cortez first opened its doors on the corner of 6th and Fremont Streets in 1941, and was so successful that it attracted the attention of Benjamin “Bugsy” Siegel and Meyer Lansky, who bought the property. In 1963 it went to another Vegas “family,” when Las Vegas icon Jackie Vaughn bought the El Cortez.

There are two ways to experience Las Vegas. The classic Vegas of the Rat Pack and Fremont Street, and the new Vegas of the Strip. When you stay at the El Cortez, you get the best of both worlds – the authenticity of a nostalgic Vegas experience and the amenities and first-class treatment expected further south along the Strip. Downtown Las Vegas is the Vegas experience you’ve been waiting for. In the 2018 LVRJ Best of Las Vegas awards, El Cortez was voted Best Downtown Hotel. Excitement, adventure, and entertainment all come together at the El Cortez Hotel & Casino. We offer an array of suites and rooms that fit your style… and ours.
